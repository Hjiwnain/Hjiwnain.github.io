One of my favorite language and I have made many projects using it for ex:- Covid-19 data predictor with the help of python i am trying to expand my knowledge in Data science.
In c++ i am quite comfortable with STL library and even working to get perfection.I am even 5 Star cooder on hackerank of c++.I love this langauge due to its complaxblitty
HTML is one of the langauge which i used to know from my school times.I have worked on many projects with langauge.But i am more in backend part so i use it only when needed.
CSS is another langauge which i used in my school times .I have been working and expanding my knowledege to maximum i.e I am currently learning tailwind CSS.So i only use it when needed.
I know this language quite well, though it is similar to C++, still I enjoy using it in some of my algo codes.Mainly i use it in app devlopement part i have made a static app "Sanjeevni".
